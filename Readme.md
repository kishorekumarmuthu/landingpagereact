I have used Tailwind CSS and React.js for the UI. Tailwind offers flexibility, rapid development, avoids unnecessary CSS code, and integrates seamlessly with React, among other advantages.

I chose React.js over Vanilla JavaScript because it provides state management, allows for easier scalability, and optimizes performance.

To set up the project, please install the necessary packages for both the backend and frontend by running the command "npm i" in the respective folders.

To start the frontend, run "npm run dev", which will start the app on port 5173.
To start the backend, run "npm start", which will launch the server on port 5000.
