I have used tailwind and Reactjs for UI. Tailwind is flexible, speedy development, avoiding unnecessary css codes, integration with react is seemless and more reasons.

I have used Reactjs instead of Vanillajs, it offers state management and the app can be easily scalable and optimize performance.

1. Please install necessary packages in backend and frontend with "npm i" command in the respective folders.
2. For starting the frontend, please use "npm run dev", it will start in port 5173
3. For starting the backend, please use "npm start", it will start in port 5000
